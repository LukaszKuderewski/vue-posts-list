# vue-list

## Information:

I wanted to avoid hardcoding author names, so on the first display, dropdown fetches the list of available authors from the API.

The authors' names in the API used do not have names, only ids, so in the application I also use only ids instead of names.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
